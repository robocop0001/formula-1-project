In this repo, I want to showcase my skills with data manipulation and visualisation.

I used the FastF1 API, Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib for multiple purposes.
To learn the API and understand F1 telemetry data, I did some basic visualisation in
`MyGraphCMP.py`. I compared telemetry data by interpolating data points (to maintain
accuracy), and then visualised it using matplotlib.

I then used this telemetry data to compare drivers head to head over a single hot
lap in qualifying over a number of mini-sectors in the lap, to see who is faster
over which part of the lap.

Then, I visualised this using matplotlib to show the faster driver in the lap.

A good example of this is the figure in the repo, which compares Verstappen's and 
Russell's qualifying time in Canada 2024. They set the exact same time (1:12.000)
and I thought it'd be interesting to see how the advantage swung between the drivers
as the lap progressed.

Have a look!
